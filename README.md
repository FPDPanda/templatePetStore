# What is that weird text?
Lorem Ipsum is a "language" that is not meant to make sense, it is used by web developers to simulate where they want their texts on a page without losing focus (by reading whatever is written) https://www.lipsum.com/

# Why are the images all the same?
Because it is just a template, those pictures would be replaced by the actual logos,pictures chosen by the owners of a pet store and pictures of the products.
